CoreFW is a full reimplementation of the firmware for the Novation Launchpad device series. Originally, it was a reverse engineering and binary injection project (`launchpad-injection-cfw`). It now supports all RGB and non-RGB Launchpads with accessible bootloaders.

> [!NOTE]
> This project does not redistribute official Novation firmware. CoreFW is custom firmware built through reverse engineering and independent reimplementation of the original firmware. This project is not affiliated with Novation.

## Installation

Visit [fw.anthonyhfm.dev](https://fw.anthonyhfm.dev) for a step-by-step installation guide that walks you through flashing CoreFW onto your Launchpad.

Alternatively, download the `.syx` file from the [releases page](../../releases) and flash it manually via the bootloader's MIDI port.

## Features

- Performance optimizations for lightshow use
  - ARM Assembly intrinsics to process inputs and lights in parallel
  - Asynchronous MIDI processing
  - Optimized flash storage read/write routines
- [Roadrunner](https://github.com/anthonyhfm/lppmk3-roadrunner) support on the Launchpad Pro Mk3 (high-speed LED system)
- Multiple built-in color palettes
  - Novation palette
  - Mat1jaczyyy palette
  - MXOS palette
  - Launchpad S (legacy) palette
- 3 flashable custom palette banks
- Color palette editor
- FastLED Apollo Support
- Performance Mode
  - Bottom row mirroring on the Launchpad Pro Mk3
- Programmer Mode
- Custom boot animation

## Build

Build a firmware package using one of the cargo aliases:

```sh
cargo <device>
```

Available `<device>` targets:

| Alias     | Device                 |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| `lppmk3`  | Launchpad Pro Mk3      |
| `lpx`     | Launchpad X            |
| `mini`    | Launchpad Mini Mk3     |
| `lpp`     | Launchpad Pro          |
| `mk2`     | Launchpad Mk2          |
| `minimk1` | Launchpad Mini Mk1     |
| `lps`     | Launchpad S            |

To build all targets at once:

```sh
cargo all
```

### Flashing the firmware manually

First of all, you need to put your Launchpad into bootloader mode.

- Unplug the Launchpad from USB, if it is connected.
- Hold the "Capture MIDI" button on the top right corner of the Launchpad.
- While holding the button, plug the Launchpad back into USB.

You are now in bootloader mode.

You can flash the firmware using our `flash.py` tooling. Here is an example for the Launchpad Pro Mk2

```shell
python3 tools/flash.py build/core-launchpad-pro.syx
```

You should see a device named something like "Launchpad MIDI Bootloader" appear in your MIDI devices list. Select it and the script will flash the firmware to your Launchpad.

After the flashing is complete, the Launchpad will automatically reboot into normal operating mode with your new firmware.
